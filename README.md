# satellite-attitude-sdp

**Semidefinite Programming (SDP)-Based Satellite Attitude Control**
This project implements a constrained quaternion-based attitude control system for a satellite using semidefinite programming(SDP). The goal is to achieve precise target tracking while respecting sun-avoidance constraints through convex optimization and geometric control techniques. Simulations are developed in MATLAB/Simulink.
