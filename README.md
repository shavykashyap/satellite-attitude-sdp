# satellite-attitude-sdp

**Semidefinite Programming (SDP)-Based Satellite Attitude Control**
This project implements a constrained quaternion-based attitude control system for a satellite using semidefinite programming(SDP). The goal is to achieve precise target tracking while respecting sun-avoidance constraints through convex optimization and geometric control techniques. Simulations are developed in MATLAB/Simulink.


# 🛰️ SDP-Based Satellite Attitude Control

This repository implements a **semidefinite programming (SDP)**-based controller for satellite attitude regulation using **quaternion dynamics**. The control system is designed to track a desired orientation while respecting geometric constraints — such as maintaining angular separation from the Sun (e.g., for sun-avoidance maneuvers in sensitive instruments).

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Control Method:** Semidefinite Programming (via YALMIP and MOSEK)
- **State Representation:** Quaternions for 3D attitude
- **Constraints:** Minimum angular separation between the satellite boresight vector and the Sun vector(Keep-out constraint), the Euler's dynamics and quaternion kinematics, the angular velocity bound , control torque bound, and the final states 
- **Simulation Environment:** MATLAB & Simulink


## 📂 Features

- Quaternion-based rigid body dynamics simulation
- Sun-exclusion zone enforced through SDP constraints
- Visual animation of satellite orientation, boresight cone, and trajectory
- Comparison framework with traditional feedback control
- Early termination based on quaternion error threshold

## How to run

1. Open the repo in MATLAB. Set the current folder to the repo root.

2. Add paths. Home → Set Path → Add with Subfolders → select the repo root → Save.

3. Configure a scenario. Edit `Code/initialize_satellite_simulation.m` (desired quaternion, torque/rate limits, cone angles). Save.

4. Solve the constrained plan (SDP). Run `initialize_satellite_simulation` that runs the `solveSDPControl.m`. This calls CVX/MOSEK and writes outputs under `Results/<run_name>`.The results are the guidance trajectory generated by the optimisation keeping the constraints in mind. 

5. Plot results. Run `plot_SDPsim_results.m` (or `plot_SDP_sim_results.mlx`). Figures are saved into the same `Results/<run_name>` folder.

6. (Optional) Track the  in Simulink. Open `CubeSat_SDP_PD_Attitude.slx`, select the mode that uses the SDP reference (or the unconstrained PD baseline), and Run.
During the Simulink run, the model logs the measured attitude quaternion, angular velocity, control torque, tracking error, and constraint margins; these logs are saved under Results/<run_name> and are used by the plotting scripts.

7. Reproduce example bundles. The folders in `Results/` (e.g., `1ki_*`, `1ko_*`, `2ki_*`, `2ko_*`, `no_constraint_plots`) come from the same steps with different cone settings. Match settings in `initialize_satellite_simulation.m` and repeat steps 4–5.
